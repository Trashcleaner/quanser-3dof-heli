TM = Test Measurement

TM1
travel - 30, elev - 10
controller: nu(1) -0.12; params mine (sligthtly customized)
voltages not saturated (can be negative)
simulation init conds all zero


TM2
travel -30, elev - 8
otherwise same as TM1
Notes: troublesome stabilization at first


TM3
travel -30, elev -10
voltages saturated (cannot be zero)
Notes: only after 60 seconds stabilizes with my help

TM4
travel -30, elev - 10
voltages not saturated
controller: nu(1); params mine
sim init conds to zero
